### **Scope**



#### Initial Feature Plan

These items must be completed for initial release:

* A Home page containing a game which can be played until the user either fails or completes the game and can then be restarted.
* A contact form allowing the user to provide detailed descriptions of suggestions to improve or develop the game, or to ask questions about the game.

### **Structure**

#### Consistency Predictability and Learnability:

This website will follow convention for its navigational elements. Predictably, these will be found at the top right of the browser window on any screen size and will be consistent in their coloring and design (although smaller screen sizes will offer a drop down option for the menu, again following convention).
Consistency will also be applied to the title on both pages and any other boxes of information a user may need to understand quickly when visiting a page for the first time.
This will give the website a high learnability and will be largely intuitive for finding the game or moving through to the Contact page. 

#### Visibility:

The website will encapsulate the vast majority of the content of each page into the viewport so the user can immediately see and understand the purpose of the page.

#### Feedback:

Feedback will be added to the website for links as well as the submission button for the planned contact form. The form will also provide feedback should there be an error with any of the form entries.
Whilst playing the game, feedback will highlight to the user the impacts of their decisions as well as the outcome of the game.
