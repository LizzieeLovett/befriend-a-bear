[Main README.md file](/README.md)

[View website in GitHub Pages](https://lizzieelovett.github.io/befriend-a-bear/)

## Testing

### Validation

- [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [W3C Markup Validation Service]( https://validator.w3.org/)
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
- The developer used **W3C CSS Validation Service**, **W3C  Markup Validation Service** and the **JSHint** validator to check the validity of the website code.

### Client stories testing:

The typical path through this website would be: 
- Home 
- As the website's main purpose is the game, the end goal is not for the users to make contact so there are no call to action buttons to encourage this. The Contact page need only be used for issues or suggestions.

### Testing client stories from UX section of README.md

1. As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate around the site so that I can find what Iâ€™m looking for as quickly as possible.
    1. The navigation bar has the same design, and can be easily found at the top of each page of the website.
    2. The game title has the same design and can also be easily found, as well as linking to the Home page to reorient any users who want to return to the typical starting point.
    3. The page names used are fairly typical across most websites so users should be able to immediately infer the content each page should contain.

2. As a new visitor to the website, I want to be able to find the rules of the game so that I can understand how to play.
    1. The Home page contains a How to Play button with a modal explaining the rules.

3. As a new visitor to the website, I want to be able to play the game soon after visiting the site to have fun.
    1. The game can be started with one click on the Home page Start Game button.
    2. The How to Play button does not need to be reviewed before the game commences as it can still be opened during the game which will prevent any delay to the user.

4. As a new visitor to the website, I want to understand how to fill out the form on the Contact page so that I can ask any questions I may have or provide suggestions.
    1. The form on the Lessons page is broken down into common items (First Name, Last Name, Email, etc.) which a typical user should have no problem with, and the less common item, Reason for Contact, is a drop down item to make the experience much easier for the user.

5. As an interested user, I want to be able to share the game with my friends so that they can play too.
    1. The Share button in the footer allows the website's URL to be copied to the clipboard to facilitate game sharing.
    2. The social media icons in the footer lead to the website's social pages which can also be easily shared.

6. As an interested user, I want to navigate to social media pages so that I can learn of any other games available or in development.
    1. The social media icons in the footer lead to the website's social pages where any updates or new games will be detailed.

7. As a returning visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate to the contact page so that I can give suggestions of game developments.
    1. The navigation bar at the top of the page provides quick and easy access to the Contact page.

8. As an animal lover, I want to be able to play a game related to animals so that I can learn more about them.
    1. Whilst the game is not entirely factual, the game is based on bears and their behaviour and some of the questions and answers are based on reality which also adds to their humour.

### Manual (logical) testing of all elements and functionality on every page.

The image sizes were reduced to improve the load time of the page._

    4. Select the correct answer to the next question. Verify that a new question is then presented with new text in the options box, and that blue feedback for a correct answer is displayed across the screen and in the Friendship Score icon. _During testing the feedback placement was not optimised for all screen sizes so this was amended to improve UX._
    5. Check that the Friendship Score value *only* has increased by 1.

    7. Select another wrong answer. Verify that the game ends and you are presented with the correct score for your choices.

2. I viewed my website on several devices and found no further issues.
